================

This is an implementation of a Learning with Errors-based Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme devise by Brakerski et. al. in "Fully homomorphic encryption without bootstrapping."

Requires the Sage library. http://www.sagemath.org/

Once Sage is installed you can start the code by:

    1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing repl.py and core.py
    2. Start SAGE
    3. Type load("repl.py")
    4. Start hacking! (There are directions, don't worry.)
